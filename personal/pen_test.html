                    A penetration test is a technique use by companies to find vulnerablities in the network. These are often performed
                    by ethical hackers. They can either be employeed by the company or come from a third party contractor. Ethical hackers 
                    mimic stratigies and attacks used  by attackers to assess how strong or weak their network is against a real attacker.<br>
                    Penetration tests are considered a proactive security measure because they are finding weaknesses before an attack occures. 
                    Nonproductive securiy measures occur after an attack occures. An example of this is to update a firewall after experiencing
                    an attack.

                <h3>What are the types of Penetration Tests?</h3>
                <p>
                    The type of penetration testers are:<br>
                    ><b>White Box Testing</b> is when the ethical hackers are given all the details about the network. They are to check the code 
                    and internal structure. This is a simulation of an insider attacker.<br>                                        
                    ><b>Black Box Testing</b> is when the ethical hackers are not given any knowledge of the network. This is a sumulation of a 
                    real-world attack.<br>
                    ><b>Gray Box Testing</b> is a combination of white box and black box testing. The ethical hackers are given partial knowledge 
                    of the network. This can include low-level credentials, logical flows, and network maps.<br>

                <h3>What are the stages to Penetration Tests?</h3>
                <p>    
                    The steps to penetration tests are:<br>
                    1. <b>Reconnaissance and planning.</b> This stage includews gathering as much information as possible about the target network. 
                    Ethical hackers learn valuable information such as network components, operating system details, open ports and access points.<br>
                    2. <b>Scanning.</b> Ethical hackers will use scanning tools to explore vulnerabilities based on the information gathered from
                    the previous steps. These tools include war dialers, port scanners, security vulnerability scanners and network mappers.<br>
                    3. <b>Obtaining entry.</b> Ethical hackers now exploit the vulnerabilities found in the previous phase. This includes performing common 
                    cyber attacks.<br>
                    4. <b>Maintaining access.</b> The ethical hacker then simulates an advanced persistent threat by staying connected to the system as long
                    as possible.<br>
                    5. <b>Analysis.</b> The ethical hacker analyzes the results gathered and compiles a report. The report includes:<br>
                    &emsp; >Vulnerabilities the testers found<br>
                    &emsp; >Sensitive data that were accessed<br>
                    &emsp; >Amount of time the tester stayed on the network<br>
                    6. <b>Cleanup and remediation.</b> Once done, the testers remove all traces of tools and processes used to infultrate. The organizations should
                    be updating and resolving issues found during the penetration test.<br>

                <h3>Why are Penetration Tests important?</h3>
                <p>Penetration Tests are important because:<br>
                    1. <b>Risk assessment.</b>The number of cyber attacks have increased over the years. Penetration tests can identify and prevent risks from occuring.<br>
                    2. <b>Security awareness.</b> cybercriminals are continuously evolving. Companies need to do the same. Companies can identify, update and replace old systems
                    by using ethical hackers.<br>
                    3. <b>Reputation.</b> People tend to lose faith in companies that have security breaches. Having penetration tests shows the company is dedicated to 
                    keeping their customer data safe.<br>
                    4. <b>Compliance.</b> Indistries like healthcare, financial institutions and service providers have regulations that require penetration tests. If they
                    do not have penetration tests, they will be out of compliance.<br>
