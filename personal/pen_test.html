            <p classs="paragraph_white">
                A penetration test is an attack simulation to assess how secure a network is. The information gathered in a penetration test can 
                be vital for a company. Companies can learn about hidden vulnerabilities in their network. Those vulnerabilities, if not resolved, 
                can be catastrophic. 
            </p>

            <h1 class="header_white">Types of Penetration Testing</h1>
            <p classs="paragraph_white">
                Penetration tests are typically done by ethical hackers. There are three main strategies when it comes to penetration testing. Each 
                strategy has strengths and weaknesses. 
            </p>
            <p classs="paragraph_white">
                1. White Box Testing: With white box testers, the organization gives the ethical hacker a full list of the internal structure of the product being tested.  
            </p>
            <p classs="paragraph_white">
                2. Black Box Testing: With black box testers, the ethical hacker has no knowledge of the infrastructure. It is a real-life simulation of what it 
                would look like for outside hackers to try and hack into the organizationâ€™s network.
            </p>
            <p classs="paragraph_white">
                3. Gray Box Testing: Gray box testers are in the middle of the white box and black box testers. They are given partial knowledge of the system and a few credentials.
