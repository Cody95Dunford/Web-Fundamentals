    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to assist in advertising and organizing the company. In this website will display different services we can perform
      and how those services will improve their overall security. The first page will be an overview of the website and everything we do. The second page will 
      be an informational page that explains what a penetration test is and the different types of penetration testers. This page is important because companies 
      need to understand what penetration tests are and how they work before in order for them to see why they need penetration tests. Page 3 will be a place we
      can add different atricles that talk about different aspects of security. This can be beneficial for companies to be up to date with different security
      trends.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The intended audiences are companies in need of security professionals to assist in securing their company. Companies can contact us and ask for a 
      penetration test to be done in their systems. This company can also provide information for anyone who wants to learn about the security trends. We have a 
      blog tab that will bring the user multiple articles that talk about security concepts. These articles can help companies stay up to date and not miss out on any vital 
      pieces of information regarding security.

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
      <a href="https://coolors.co/7666fb-f49c9c-ebe3e3-bcb5ee-f4a6a6"
        target="_blank">https://coolors.co/7666fb-f49c9c-ebe3e3-bcb5ee-f4a6a6</a>
